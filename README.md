## A visualization framework for acoustic ecology applications

Seecology is a framework for feature extraction and visualization of ecological recordings, providing an easy way to visualize the resulting data immediately after the extraction process. Our solution provides a simple method to extract data with individual settings for each feature.

Among the visualizations available at this moment, we provide a comparative line chart with media player capabilities, a concentric radviz with a labeling system to help create annotated datasets and a boat detection visualization to display the result of a novel algorithm developed during my PhD, called FAVS (Frequency Amplitude Variation Signature), capable of high sensitive detection of the presence (With specific signatures) of vessels, even in noisy conditions.

More visualizations will be added in the next few months.

## Installation procedures
On [Seecology/Install/SETUP_Seecology.sh](https://github.com/clausiusreis/Seecology/blob/master/Seecology/Install/SETUP_Seecology.sh) can be found a script to help with the setup process of the libraries. The framework was designed to work on a Linux Mint 19.1 Cinnamon machine, however, the code should be able to run on most machines, provided that libraries versions and paths (Windows) are respected.

## Tutorial
Currently in development, will be available shortly.
